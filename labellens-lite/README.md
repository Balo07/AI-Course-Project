# LabelLens Lite â€” Food Allergen & Diet Checker (React + Tailwind)

A super-simple app that helps you quickly check food products for allergens and diet tags (vegan/vegetarian), plus Nutri-Score and NOVA group. It uses the **Open Food Facts** public API (no API key required).

> This project demonstrates the power of generative AI in the development process: I used an AI assistant to plan scope, scaffold the UI, write helper code, draft documentation, and suggest a tiny unit test.

## Quick start
1) `npm install`
2) `npm run dev`
